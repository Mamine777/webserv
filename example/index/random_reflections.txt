There's something fascinating about old train stations. The way the echoes linger under the vaulted ceilings, the scent of metal and rain mixing in the air. Every person is a story in motion-departing, arriving, waiting.  

I saw a man today who looked like he had stepped out of another era. Long coat, leather briefcase, an absent stare as if he was remembering something distant. Or maybe he was just lost.  

Funny how places filled with so much movement can feel frozen in time.
