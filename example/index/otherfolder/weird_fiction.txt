They say if you take the third left after midnight and walk exactly thirteen steps past the old oak, you'll find a door that wasn't there before.  

Nobody knows where it leads.  

Some say it's a gateway to another world. Others whisper that it's a trap-a place that swallows those who dare to open it.  

But the truth is stranger still.  

The door doesn't take you anywhere.  

It just makes sure you were never here to begin with.
