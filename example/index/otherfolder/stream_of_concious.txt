It's always the little things that stick. A half-finished cup of tea. A song heard through a stranger's headphones on the train. The way someone says your name like it means something.  

You tell yourself you won't forget, but of course, you do.  

Then, one day, you're walking down a street you've never been on, in a city you don't belong to, and there it is-
That same song.  
That same feeling.  
Like a thread tying the past to the present, reminding you that nothing is ever really lost.
