Long ago, in a village at the edge of the forest, there lived a girl with hair as dark as the midnight sky. They called her Solna, the Dreamer, for she could weave dreams into reality with just a whisper.

One night, a stranger arrived at her door, cloaked in mist and silence. "Tell me a story," he said, his voice like rustling leaves.  

So she spoke of stars that danced, rivers that sang, and shadows that longed to be free.  

And as she spoke, the mist around him unraveled-revealing not a man, but the spirit of the forest itself.
