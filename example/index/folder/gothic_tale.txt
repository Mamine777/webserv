The candle sputtered, casting frantic shadows against the damp stone walls. Eleanor clutched her shawl tighter as the chill seeped through her bones. She had heard the stories-whispers of lost souls trapped within the manor, of doors that locked themselves, of footsteps in empty halls.

A gust of wind extinguished the candle. Darkness swallowed her whole.

Then, a voice.  
Soft, distant.  
Calling her name.  

She did not turn around.  
She did not have to.  
She already knew what she would see.
